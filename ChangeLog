	* Other big chunks of PHP warning fixes.

	* Remove Savannah-specific code from Download.pm - it's now
	unused.

	* find -name "*.php" -print0 | xargs -r0 sed -i -e
	's/$PHP_SELF/$_SERVER['\''PHP_SELF'\'']/g'

	* sed -i -e
	's/$GLOBALS\[.\?REMOTE_ADDR.\?\]/$_SERVER['\''REMOTE_ADDR'\'']/g'
	include/session.php account/lostpw-confirm.php

	* Merged Savane changes - bugfix about MySQL5's mysqldump using
	MySQL5-specific instructions.

2006-12-10  Sylvain Beucler  <beuc@beuc.net>

	* Show WWW repository ViewCVS link even if the URL differ from the
	group type default. This puzzled users more than it helped
	them. Possibly showing/adding the 'Homepage' link should be
	possible - but currently the 'active features' page is a bit
	messy.

2006-12-03  Sylvain Beucler  <beuc@beuc.net>

	* Lots of PHP warnings and PHP5 fixes; I try to run Savane with
	error_reporting = E_ALL | E_STRICT, register_globals=off,
	magic_quotes=off to clean-up the code.

	* frontend/php/include/utils.php: Removed lowercasing in fb(), as
	well as other code expecting that $msg is a single sentence - this
	is often not the case.

	* PHP5 fix: sed -i -e
	's/$GLOBALS\[.\?PHP_SELF.\?\]/$_SERVER['\''PHP_SELF'\'']/g'
	my/quitproject.php include/pre.php
	include/trackers_run/admin/field_values_reset.php
	include/trackers/general.php include/trackers/general.php

	* Detect when php-mysql is not installed and reports the error
	clearly.

	* ChangeLog.byversion -> NEWS

	* Introduce a smaller default SVN repository creation, with no
	default architecture. Move Gna-style default layout to the Attic
	sub.

2006-11-30  Sylvain Beucler  <beuc@beuc.net>

	* backend/accounts/sv_membersh.pl: uses
	/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin as PATH (reverse order compared to
	before, includes /usr/local/bin) - this is the default Debian PATH

	* account/login.php: Uses HTTP 302 redirections to detect cookies
	immediately.

	* Don't try to chmod ~/.ssh/authorized_keys if doesn't exists.

	* Fixed warnings in /users/<username due to uninitialized vars.
