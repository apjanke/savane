	* Lots of PHP warnings and PHP5 fixes; I try to run Savane with
	error_reporting = E_ALL | E_STRICT, register_globals=off,
	magic_quotes=off to clean-up the code.

	* frontend/php/include/utils.php: Removed lowercasing in fb(), as
	well as other code expecting that $msg is a single sentence - this
	is often not the case.

	* PHP5 fix: sed -i -e
	's/$GLOBALS\[.\?PHP_SELF.\?\]/$_SERVER['\''PHP_SELF'\'']/g'
	my/quitproject.php include/pre.php
	include/trackers_run/admin/field_values_reset.php
	include/trackers/general.php include/trackers/general.php

	* Detect when php-mysql is not installed and reports the error
	clearly.

	* ChangeLog.byversion -> NEWS

	* Introduce a smaller default SVN repository creation, with no
	default architecture. Move Gna-style default layout to the Attic
	sub.

	* backend/accounts/sv_membersh.pl: uses
	/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin as PATH (reverse order compared to
	before, includes /usr/local/bin) - this is the default Debian PATH

	* account/login.php: Uses HTTP 302 redirections to detect cookies
	immediately.

	* Don't try to chmod ~/.ssh/authorized_keys if doesn't exists.

	* Fixed warnings in /users/<username due to uninitialized vars.
