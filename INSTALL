Testing
~~~~~~~

If you want to give a quick try at the web interface:

	cd tests/minimal_configs/
	make install

Then point your browser at http://localhost:50080/
That's all!

You need 'apache2', 'mysqld_safe' and 'mysql' binaries in your
PATH. They will be used with alternate configuration files to create a
non-privileged testing environment, and will not impact your other
Apache or MySQL installations.


Complete install
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	# Configure system paths [1]
	./configure.sh
	# build what need to be built
	make
	# log as superuser
	su
	# create the database
	make database
	# create the configuration file (WIP)
	# make conf
	emacs /etc/savane/savane.conf.pl
	# install the backend scripts and the translation files
	make install

	
	# OR do all of the above all at once (WIP)
	#./configure
	#su -c "make savane"

Then, you must plug Savane into Apache. Exemple if you want to install Savane
at yourdomain/savane: 

  Alias /savane $path_to_savane/frontend/php

  <Directory $path_to_savane/frontend/php>
      # Pure apache conf:
      SetEnv SAVANE_CONF /etc/savane
      Options SymLinksIfOwnerMatch
      DirectoryIndex index.php
      AllowOverride None
      #Necessary with apache2: AcceptPathInfo On
      ErrorDocument 404 /savane/404.php
      Order allow,deny
      Allow from all

      # Configure some specials urls:
      <Files u>
          ForceType application/x-httpd-php
      </Files>
      <Files us>
          ForceType application/x-httpd-php
      </Files>
      <Files users>
          ForceType application/x-httpd-php
      </Files>
      <Files projects>
          ForceType application/x-httpd-php
      </Files>
      <Files pr>
          ForceType application/x-httpd-php
      </Files>
      <Files p>
          ForceType application/x-httpd-php
      </Files>
      <Files file>
          ForceType application/x-httpd-php
      </Files>

      # Restrict access to testconfig
      <Files testconfig.php>
          Order Deny,Allow
          Allow from 127.0.0.1
          Deny from All
      </Files>
  </Directory>
  # Restrict access into include/
  <Directory $path_to_savane/frontend/php/include>
	Order Allow,Deny
	Deny from all
  </Directory>
	
If you use the backend, read also etc/README.

	# Afterwards, you should check 
	# http://127.0.0.1/savane/testconfig.php

(please read carefully INSTALL.verbose for a more complete guide)


Notes
~~~~~

[1] If you checked out Savane directly from the repository (instead of
downloading a release tarball), you first need to install the
autotools (Autoconf and Automake), and bootstrap the build system:

	./boostrap
