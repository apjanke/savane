   script that remove xml exports that were done and (removed by the user
   via the frontend).
   basically, it gets the list of exports known in the database and remove
   files that are not in this list.

   FIXME: it could remove files that are older than 2 weeks, but currently
   it does not.
   FIXME: it could remove empty directories, but currently it does not.
