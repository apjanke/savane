These files allow Savane to be used on Mac OS X/Darwin
properly. The qustion about a prefix for new user/group
commands should be pointed at this folder (backend/darwin).
The sv_ni_dump script is used to extact the netinfo information
into flat files so sv_users, and sv_groups knows what to do with it

Important Note: Do not use /Users as your home folder,
sv_groups/sv_users flattens paths, and it can cause 
issues with other programs. Create a /home, and use
that instead.

The Darwin User tools (with the expection of usermod)
are from OSX User Utils package (http://www.osxgnu.org)
and are licensed under the GPL.
