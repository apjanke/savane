### CONTENT OF THIS DIRECTORY

db/mysql/* files for mysql db
db/old/* old files

### CONTENT OF THOSE DIRECTORIES (old excluded):

*.structure : 
	  describe the structure of a file or a database
*.initvalues:
	  set the initials values required for a file or a database

database_*  :
	  describe/set a complete database
table_*	    :
	  describe/set a complete table

### THE 100 VALUE AND MYSQL

There are recurrent troubles with the 100 entries with our tables. That's why the value 100 is already set on almost every tables.

### INSTALL

For now, the better method is to type:
    mysql -u user -p  database < mysql/database_savannah.structure
    mysql -u user -p  database < mysql/database_savannah.initvalues

In the future, you will be able to insert in a modular way each table.
And it will be cleaner than using the previously explained method, since
only SV2 tables are in table_* format. 



### UPDATE

Don't update the *structure files manually. Use sv_export_db to do
it.
