If you've got Apache2 and MySQL installed, you can use these
configuration files to easily launch throw-away test servers, that can
be run by a non-privileged user.

To test ./configure.sh, specify an alternate MySQL socket:

./configure.sh \
  --with-db-options="-S devel/tests/minimal_configs/mysqld/db/sock"
make database
