Hi,

you are noted as the last translator of the translation of Savane.
The English template has been changed, and now some messages
are marked fuzzy in your translation or are missing.

We would be grateful if you could take the time and update it.

If you do not have SVN write access, please post a bug report including
the po file as attached file.

Thanks,
