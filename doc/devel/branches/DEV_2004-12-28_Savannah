mainstream.

Done:
~~~~~

* Added a MySQL option for Perl in the $sys_dbparams configuration
variable. Change in DB.pm

* Updated sv_update_conf.pl to take the new variable into account

* Added MakeCvsAttic-like procedures that actually takes the frontend
params into account for the CVS repository. Then we should work on
externalizing this kind of procedures.

* Removed the reference to 'fingerprint' in "Edit GPG key".

* Changed the 'savannah' theme to make it comply with the CSS
guidelines v1.10 - and with the new HTML layout

* Added code to manage GPG keys, and a --gpg option to sv_users

* Added send_registration_notification.php, so send again a
notification to the admins if a project registration mail was lost
