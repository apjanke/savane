// Savannah - Forbidden themes
// 
//    You can fed $forbid_theme_regexp by a perl regexp
//    with theme names you want to forbid on your system.
//
//    The theme name given in this regexp must not have the extension
//    .css.
//
//    This forbid_theme_regexp site specific variable be useful if you 
//    do not want to provide to users every  themes available for Savannah,
//    for instance because some of them creates troubles with a browser
//    widely used in your company/organisation.
//
//    By default, Savane forbid only themes which have been made for
//    a specific installation and are very very close to a more generic
//    theme.
//    If you run a public server, please do not use these themes as default
//    to avoid confusions for users.
//

// The perl regexp:
//    The two slashes (/ /) are mandatory, see the preg_match manual.
//    Theme names are at this step uncapitalized
//    (currently, nov 2006):
//    	savanedu is a modified version of savannah
//      cern is a CERN-specific version of Emeraud
$GLOBALS['forbid_theme_regexp'] = "/^(savanedu|ugent|cern)$/";
