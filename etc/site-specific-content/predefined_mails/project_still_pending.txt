Hi,

There are several projects that was registered since a long time (the
delay depends on your installation configuration), without still being
moderated.

Someone of the admins may handle these registrations, to help the admin
in charge.  If, as admin, you do so, please tell others admin directly via
a mail, in order to avoid duplicating efforts.
