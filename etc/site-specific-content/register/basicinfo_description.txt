Replace this paragraph by the technical description of your
project (approximately 20 lines should be OK). Do not
forget to include a URL to the source code, even if it
is not a functional version (it will be easier to sort out
licensing problems now, rather than having your project
rejected later on). If you do not have any code
to show yet, then say that explicitly.
