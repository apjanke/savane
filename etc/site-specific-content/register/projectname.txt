<p>
You now have to choose a name for your project.
There are two types of names that will be associated with this project.
</p>

<p>
The "Full Name" is descriptive, not too restrictive (except from
a 40 character limit) and you can change it later on. The "System Name"
can only be changed by the administrators and has several restrictions 
("system" refers to the fact that it will identify areas of your project, 
and not to the operating system your project uses).
</p>

The restrictions for the system name are:

<ul>
<li>It cannot match the system name of any other project</li>
<li>It must be between 3 and 16 characters in length</li>
<li>It can only contain text characters, numbers, and dashes
(no + signs)</li>
<li>It must be a valid GNU/Linux username</li>
<li>It cannot match one of our reserved domains</li>
</ul>

<p>
Your system name is important because it will be used for
many things, including:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Directory names</li>
<li>CVS repository name</li>
<li>Group names</li>
<li>Project searches throughout the site</li>
</ul>
