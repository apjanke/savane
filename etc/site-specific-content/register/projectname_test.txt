// Savannah - Project registration STEP 3 Project name Test
//    Here, you can test the project name as you want. If ok, 
//    user must be redirected to the next step, if not, user should
//    change his name
//    BEWARE, this file content must be PHP, with no parse-error.
//    Do not modify it until you really know what you're doing.
//

// On savannah.gnu.org, we want incitate people to choose "free"
// instead of "open".
// You can implement test as you want, uncomment this one...
// If you do not way any test, projectname_do_the_test() should
// return 0 in any case.

// this appears as functions - it's easier to include it
// without trouble with $vars

function projectname_do_the_test ($test_on_name, $form_unix_name, $form_full_name) {
  // we test only if is hasnt been already done
//  if ($test_on_name != "1") {
//      $search="open";
      // we test if $search is in unix_name0
//      if (preg_match("/$search/i", $form_unix_name)) { 
//	 $need_to_print_warning = "1"; 
//      }
      // we test if $search is in group_name
//      if (preg_match("/$search/i", $form_full_name)) {	
//	 $need_to_print_warning = "1"; 
//      }
//  }
//  if ($need_to_print_warning != "1") { 
     $need_to_print_warning = "0";
//  }

function projectname_test_error_message() {
	 return 'Our aim is to host free software projects, and we want to encourage
  the public to think of them as free software projects.  A project
  name that says "open" is likely to encourage people to think of
  the project as "open source" instead of "free software".  Would
  you please choose a project name with "free" instead of "open"?
  If you think there is an important reason to use the name "open"
  in this particular project name, please add comment about it in your registration - you can do this at the confirmation step.<br>Without statement about it, the registration will be discarded in any case!';
