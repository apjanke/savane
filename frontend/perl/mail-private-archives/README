index.pl is a tool that permits to use Savane session
to access mailing-list (or any other list) archives.

The idea is not too completely mix savane password, session, with mailman
ones, as mailman password are insecure (send uncrypted by mail, etc...) but
to ease archives browsing.

To make use of this module, you need the savane libs installed, and
savane configured. 

It assumes that the private archives are physically located in
	/var/www/private/

You need to configure apache like described in savane/etc/apache-mail.
