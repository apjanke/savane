Forum information:
------------------
($Id$)

The forums (fora) have not been used for a long time. During
this time they have been abused for the news. This is why things
are not clearly seperated and a bit messy.

The forums should not be used by people who expect productive use
(although I'm using them for production). If you're furious and
painless, well: go ahead.


Mailinglist behaviour:
----------------------
The forums can be used as Mailinglists. This requires turning on
an undocumented option that is undocumented for good reasons. One
is that this does not completely comply with the savannah philosophy
the other is that the implementation has some performance issues on
the database. Support is not given. However, if you are interested,
make sure to read the sources in php/forum/* and php/include/news/forum.php.
