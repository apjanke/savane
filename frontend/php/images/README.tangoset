This icons set is the one proposed by http://tango.freedesktop.org/Tango_Desktop_Project to provide something standard among environments.

The most wonderful idea would be to have web browsers capable of using desktop  icons in webapps (for instance, in a tag <img desktopicon="home" src="alternativeicon.png">, home will be correctly interpreted and the desktop own icon for home would show up), but until this is achieved, it can be nice to use these tango icons.

We will attempt to do so as soon as there are all the icons we need available. At first, we will try to see how it fits on a limit set of theme (which will have their own *.theme symlinking to this dir).

We will also use the tango filenames, putting symlinks to map with Savane current icon names.
