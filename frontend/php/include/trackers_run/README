This directory contains files that should be included by trackers using the 
common tracker code.

They may do that or not, depending on their purpose.
Most of them will do.

See in frontend/php/bugs for an example of inclusion.
Most trackers are like the bug tracker, and as such are merely symlinks against
 its main directory.

For instance:
	- frontend/php/bugs do include of files 
	frontend/php/include/trackers_run
	- frontend/php/support and frontend/php/task are symlinks against
	frontend/php/bugs
