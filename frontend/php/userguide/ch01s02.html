      platform works</h2></div></div></div><p>In such a platform, we will have different kinds of users:
      platform maintainers, project members, generic users. Each of
      them will have different access level to various services and
      artifacts. <span class="application">Savane</span> provides the
      following pre-defined role scheme to control access and
      use:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Anonymous user</p><p>Anyone visiting the
	  platform web pages. Will be able to read public information,
	  and depending on project configuration, post items on
	  certain trackers.</p></li><li><p>Logged-in user</p><p>Anyone who has
	  registered a user account at the platform. Will be able to
	  request project registration, as well as posting items on
	  certain trackers (depending on project
	  configuration).</p></li><li><p>Group member</p><p>Any registered user member
	  of a group. Will be able to post on trackers, as well having
	  access to system services, via the web pages or via shell
	  (user accounts are provided at the system running
	  Savane). Access to tracker item handling will depend on
	  specific group member roles (we'll see this in more detail
	  in the last chapter):
	  </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Technician</p></li><li><p>Manager</p></li><li><p>Manager and Technician</p></li></ul></div><p>
          </p></li><li><p>Project administrators</p><p>A user that
	  registers a project becomes project administrator. Will be
	  able to configure project's services and set access level
	  for trackers and news.</p></li><li><p>System (server) administrators: superuser</p><p>Controls the whole platform, configuring services
	  offered for different kinds of projects.</p></li></ol></div><div class="sect2" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2468957"></a>Levels of configuration</h3></div></div></div><p>Configuration of a <span class="application">Savane</span> site
      is therefore done at three different levels:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Site administration</p><p>Will define what services to implement in general, and
	  will configure different group types with different default
	  values and services.</p><p>Can manage platform users
	  and projects. (Delete, accept, assign to a group)</p></li><li><p>Project administration</p><p>Will inherit defaults and service settings from the
	  group type it belongs to, but will be able to deactivate
	  certain services, and customize certain artifacts. (If site
	  administrators allow it, it will be possible to configure
	  many of the project's links)</p><p>Can accept users
	  to the group, and manage roles of project members.</p></li><li><p>Individual user account</p><p>Personal information management, configuration of
	  personal notifications.</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2469020"></a>Administration of a <span class="application">Savane</span> powered site</h3></div></div></div><p>A <span class="application">Savane</span> powered site will be
      administered through a special kind of project, hosted at the
      own site, thus benefiting from all the tools provided for
      projects.</p><p>For example, site administrators' responsibility for
      approving/rejecting projects seeking hosting at the site is
      handled via the administration project's task tracker (new
      project request will appear as a new opened task).</p><p>The services that will be offered to projects are totally
      customizable by site administrators, who can chose to
      offer/deactivate different features or artifacts. One important
      feature of <span class="application">Savane</span> is the "Group type"
      (=project type). Different types of projects can be defined by
      site administrators, setting different services and default
      values according to project nature. In this way, through a
      unique platform and application, administrators have the
      possibility to offer quite different services, and different
      levels of system access and customization, depending on project type.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="?file=ch01.html">Prev</a>&#160;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="?file=ch01.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&#160;<a accesskey="n" href="?file=ch02.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Chapter&#160;1.&#160;Introduction to <span class="application">Savane</span>&#160;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="?file=index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&#160;Chapter&#160;2.&#160;Users</td></tr></table></div>
