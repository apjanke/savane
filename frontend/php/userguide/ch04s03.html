      can be taken:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Follow up comments can be posted. Canned responses can
	  be defined, giving generic answers to common problems, and
	  thus saving a lot of time. No default canned responses are
	  available, and must be defined for each particular
	  project. Attached files can also be included.</p></li><li><p>Mail notification CC list. List of email addresses to
	  be notified upon updates of the item.</p></li><li><p>Dependencies. A search facility is provided to find
	  other items to set dependency relationships with. These can
	  be established across tracker kinds (support to bug, etc)
	  and across projects.</p></li><li><p>Item reassignation. An item can be moved from one
	  tracker to another, for example a support request can be
	  moved into the bug tracker. It can also be reassigned to a
	  different project.</p></li><li><p>Finally, a history of item changes is provided.</p></li></ul></div><p>However, not all these possibilities will be open to any
      project member, since there are different predefined roles for
      tracker and item handling. When a user becomes part of a group,
      he/she will inherit a default role, defined by
      <span class="application">Savane</span> server administrators for the
      group type, or by the own project administrator. Through
      <span class="guimenu">Administration</span>-&gt;<span class="guimenuitem">Set
      Member Permissions</span> menu, project
      admin will be able to edit default role values for new members,
      as well as assign roles to members on an individual basis (an
      editable list of group members and their roles is
      displayed).</p><div class="sect2" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id2470093"></a>Tracker roles</h3></div></div></div><p>Below are the

	trackers:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Technicians:</p><p>Only technicians can be assigned
	tracker's items. They cannot reassign items, change their status
	or priority.</p></li><li><p>Managers:</p><p>Managers can fully manage
	tracker items, including assigning items to technicians,
	reassigning items over trackers and projects, changing
	priority and status of items - but they cannot configure the
	trackers.</p></li><li><p>Project admins:</p><p>Can manage members,
	configure the trackers, post jobs, and add mailing-list. They
	actually also have manager rights on every tracker and are
	allowed to read private items.</p></li></ul></div></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="?file=ch04s02.html">Prev</a>&#160;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="?file=ch04.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&#160;</td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Tracker configuration&#160;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="?file=index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&#160;</td></tr></table></div>
