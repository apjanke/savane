#    You can fed $specific_forbid_group_regexp by a perl regexp
#    with group names you want to forbid on your system.
#
#    It means that it will not possible to register a project with a name
#    that match that list.
#
#    This would constitue an additional list of group name to forbid.
#    If you want the system to only take account of that list, not to
#    take account of the Savannah hardcoded list, set the variable
#        $only_specific_forbid_group_regexp = 1;
#


// The perl regexp:
//    The two slashes (/ /) are mandatory, see the preg_match manual.
$GLOBALS['specific_forbid_group_regexp'] = 0;

// Disregard the Savannah default list (dangerous)
$GLOBALS['only_specific_forbid_group_regexp'] = 0;
