/*
This is a PHP rounter file,
used only for savannah local development when running
under php's built-in web server.

It solves two issues:

1.
On savannah's production server,
EVERY file under ./frontend/php is treated as a PHP file,
regardless of '.php' extensions.
This allows URLs like:
  https://sv.gnu.org/projects/coreutils

to execute ./frontend/php/projects (which is a PHP file without extension).

The PHP built-in server doesn't like this at all.

So we detect two specific cases ('projects' and 'users')
and load the PHP files explicitly.

All other cases are passed as-is to the PHP webserver (with 'return false')
which will then load the corresponding PHP file and work as expected.


2.
Savane uses gettext for internationalization,
and it's annoying to set it up (requires fiddling
with php's configuration file).
If 'php-gettext' is not available, fake the require
functions.




See run-local-dev.sh' file to see how this file is used
(as the last parameter to 'php -S').
