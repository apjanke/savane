TRANSLATION writing/editing guidelines:
---------------------------------------
($Id$)

To add a new language, a file $lang.po must be added. Site-specific content can be added too, by adding new files called thistextfile.$lang.

And finally, each time a new language is added, frontend/php/include/i18n must be edited.

Rules:
------
  - Punctuation marks are part of the translation! They must be inside gettext
    string. For instance, there is a space before all the ; in French, while
    there is none in English. Then, think about languages written from the
    right to the left...
  - Avoiding anglicism as possible is important. 
    I18n means something only if we do not assume that people have to learn
    english anyway. So "mail" is not a correct french translation for "mail", 
    for instance. Courriel is a nice one.


Tips:
-----
  - Running aspell/ispell periodically is a good option.
  - Running make refresh-po after editing a po file tells you if you made a
    syntax error.
