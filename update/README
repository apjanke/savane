This directory is supposed to contain files useful to upgrade from one
version of savane to another.


* For example, if you want to upgrade to the release 1.0.3 you should
run the scripts within the directory 1.0.3

sql files must be run like
    mysql dbname < file.sql

Other scripts must be run like
    ./file.pl


* When what needs to be done is more complex, a README is included in the
directory.
